        <h3>Background</h3>
        
          <p>The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled with semi-     
            isolation provided by deserts to the east and west, allowed for the development of one 
            of the world's great civilizations. A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C., and a 
            series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native 
            dynasty fell to the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn were replaced by the Greeks, 
            Romans, and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who introduced Islam and the Arabic language
            in the 7th century and who ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste, 
            the Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the conquest of 
            Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Completion of the Suez Canal in 1869 elevated 
            Egypt as an important world transportation hub. Ostensibly to protect its investments, 
            Britain seized control of Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the 
            Ottoman Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt 
            acquired full sovereignty from Britain in 1952. The completion of the Aswan High Dam 
            in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have reaffirmed the time-honored place of the 
            Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the 
            largest in the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all 
            continue to overtax resources and stress society. The government has struggled to meet 
            the demands of Egypt's fast-growing population as it implements large-scale
            infrastructure projects, energy cooperation, and foreign direct investment appeals.
            Inspired by the 2010 Tunisian revolution, Egyptian opposition groups led demonstrations and labor strikes countrywide, culminating in President Hosni MUBARAK's ouster in 2011. Egypt's military assumed national leadership until a new legislature was in place in early 2012; later that same year, Muhammad MURSI won the presidential election. Following protests throughout the spring of 2013 against MURSI's government and the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian Armed Forces intervened and removed MURSI from power in July 2013 and replaced him with interim president Adly MANSOUR. Simultaneously, the government began enacting laws to limit freedoms of assembly and expression. In January 2014, voters approved a new constitution by referendum and in May 2014 elected former defense minister Abdelfattah ELSISI president. Egypt elected a new legislature in December 2015, its first House of Representatives since 2012. ELSISI was reelected to a second four-year term in March 2018. In April 2019, Egypt approved via national referendum a set of constitutional amendments extending ELSISI’s term in office through 2024 and possibly through 2030 if reelected for a third term. The amendments would also allow future presidents up to two consecutive six-year terms in office, reestablish an upper legislative house, allow for one or more vice presidents, establish a 25% quota for female legislators, reaffirm the military’s role as guardian of Egypt, and expand presidential authority to appoint the heads of judicial councils.</p>
