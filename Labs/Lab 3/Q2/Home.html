                <h3>What is My Hobby?</h3>
                    
                <p>I have a personal and deep rooted instrest in the sport of Formula 1.</p>
                    
                <h3>What is Formula 1?</h3>
                    
                <p>Formula One racing is governed and sanctioned by a world body called the FIA − Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile or the International Automobile Federation. The name ‘Formula’ comes from the set of rules that the participating cars and drivers must follow. The objective of a Formula 1 contest is to determine the winner of a race.</p>
                    
                <h3>How can this be a Hobby?</h3>
                    
                <p>Due to this being a poular sport it also comes with an offical video game to allow anyone to simulate in a single or multipkayer setting the real F1 season. This can be incredibly enjoyable as a comptition with friends to emulate the real life competition.</p>
                    
                <p>It is also an offical esports video game. This means that it is possible to become so good at the game and its mechanics that you can compete for a montary gifet. Now i am not this good but it goes to show how high up one can go in what is just a video game</p>
